# Employee_Survey_R
Exploring employee survey responses with R. The beautiful thing about using these tools is that there are always more efficient ways to write code, other libraries to explore, etc.  As you learn more, you can implement better, more efficient ways of doing your analysis, and you will decide which libraries you prefer for each type of analytics task. In some cases, I kept various code iterations to demonstrate my thought process. This way, you can understand the impact of the code changes instead of just seeing the final code.  If you need further explanation of any code, copy it and ask ChatGPT, Bard, etc., to explain it step by step.  If you get an error you don't understand, you can do the same…ask for an explanation and how to debug the code. 

# REMINDERS
1. Make back-ups of all vectors, data frames, etc., before running any major transformations. This way, you can revert to prior data post-transformation.  
2. You only need to install.packages("") once, but you have to load the libraries that you need for each session.

# SURVEY BACKGROUND
It's important to understand the specific objectives of your survey analysis. Are you looking to identify trends, understand respondent sentiment, or something else? This is an initial analysis of an anonymous qualitative survey.  The survey is anonymous to prompt respondents to freely share their thoughts. The intent of the survey is to get a pulse on an at-risk subset of the employee population. This is a way to understand "What" makes them excited and "What" makes them unhappy about the organization. This is a way to understand "if" they are thinking of leaving, if so, "What" could make them stay.  

# LET'S GET STARTED/APPROACH TO ANALYSIS
Data Exploration: Examine your dataset to understand its structure and the types of variables and get a general sense of the data.
•	Load Data in R or Rstudio [IDE - integrated development environment], which I use to manage and execute R code.
•	Identify Variable Types: Differentiate between categorical (e.g., multiple choice) and numerical (e.g., rating scales) data.
•	Check for Missing Values: Identify and decide how to handle missing data (e.g., imputation, removal). Depending on your data, you might fill in missing values with mean/median (for numerical data) or the     mode (for categorical data) or decide to remove rows/columns with missing values.
•	Data Formatting: Ensure format consistency, especially for dates, categorical responses, and text entries.
•	Detect Outliers: Use summary statistics and boxplots to identify outliers in your data. Depending on the context, you might remove, adjust, or keep values.  
•	Error Checking: Look for errors or inconsistencies in the data (e.g., impossible values in a rating scale). Ensure all data falls within expected ranges. Decide how to rectify any anomalies found.
•	Some functions to use to explore your data: 
•	head(), summary(), and str() to get an overview of your data
•	is.na() to check for missing values and sum() to summarize them
•	as.character() to ensure consistent formats. For example, convert character strings to factors

Data Cleaning: This step ensures data quality and involves handling missing values, correcting errors, and standardizing formats.
•	Data Transformation: You may need to transform data into a format suitable for analysis, like aggregating certain responses or recoding variables for analysis (coding open-ended responses or column           headers/names).  

Descriptive statistics: Calculate measures like mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical data to get a feel for your data.

Visualization: Create initial plots, such as histograms or boxplots, for numerical data or bar charts for categorical data to visualize the distribution and identify potential outliers or patterns.

Thematic Analysis: For open-ended questions, categorize responses and identify key themes. Conduct text analysis.

Cross-tabulation and Cluster Analysis: Depending on the types of questions, understand relationships in matrixed and multiple-choice questions. (AS NEEDED. Note: Don't be afraid if you can only accomplish the prior steps.  They are a great start to understanding your data.  And some knowledge gained quickly is oftentimes better than deep knowledge that comes too late.)

Advanced Analysis: Apply statistical tests where appropriate, like t-tests, ANOVA, or regression analysis. (Note: Same as above)
